        <p>In Ancient Egypt, slaves had no shoes or wore sandals made of palm leaves. The Commoner wore sandals made
            from papyrus. <br>Those in higher status were allowed to wear pointed sandals. The colors red and yellow
            were
            reserved for the highest society only. <br> It would be easy to see which status of society one belonged to
            by
            simply looking at the footwear they wore.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t until 1818, that the right shoe was invented. Until that time, there was no distinction between
            shoes made for left or right <br>feet. The first pair of right and left footed shoes were made in
            Philadelphia.
            Obviously, shoes weren’t made for comfort up to this point.</p>
